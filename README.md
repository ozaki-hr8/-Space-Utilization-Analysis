# Space Utilization Analysis Using Humanâ€“Object Interaction Recognition

# Introduction
To provide deeper information to human operators and control the robot in an intelligent space respectively, we proposed a novel method to infer space utilization from human state recognition data as an open-set solution using the word vector model which could greatly reduce labor cost for space monitoring and provide better generalization.
